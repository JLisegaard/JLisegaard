Hi, 

And welcome to my GitHub!


I'm Jesper, and my current occupation is as a master student at the Technical University of Denmark, where I study Mathematical Modelling and Computation. 


My current interests of study are simulations, optimization, and applications of these techniques. 


See you around!


Best regards

Jesper Lisegaard
